# Movies-explorer backend
This is a repository for the graduation project, including the backend part of the Movies-explorer application.

This repository contains the backend part of the movies-explorer project. Link to the main project: https://github.com/EazyXxX/movies-explorer-frontend

To write the server part of the application, I used NodeJS and Express. 
This is a public repository. If you want to use this server code, you can download it as archive, unpack it and run the server either on your pc or uploaded on any virtual machine - as you prefer.
